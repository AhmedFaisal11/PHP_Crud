        Simple Crud App
if you want to use it 
then just clone this repository or download zip file and extracrt it and past all the files under htdocs folder(if you are using xampp)
then just make a datbase named 'class_curd' and table 'user' with columns 'id' , 'username' , 'email'. And make sure to check conn.php file for connection with databse replace all the credientail with yours then you are good to go


Thanks
